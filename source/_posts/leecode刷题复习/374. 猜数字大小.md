```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = n 
        while left<=right:
            num = random.randint(left,right)
            compare = guess(num)
            print(num,compare)
            if compare==1:
                left = num + 1 
            elif compare==-1:
                right = num - 1
            elif compare==0:
                return num 
            print((left,right))
